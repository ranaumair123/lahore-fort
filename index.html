               <p>Lahore fort
                Boasting a spellbinding architecture, Lahore Fort is also counted among the five most popular historical forts in Pakistan. The place wasn't as quiet and as peaceful as it looks today, in fact, it was one of the busiest buildings in the region as it was home to the royal emperors of the Mughal reign.
                
                Lahore Fort is the main attraction in Lahore's old walled city, housing the marble palaces, mosques, and lush gardens from the city's golden age under the Mughal dynasty, when Lahore became the place of royal residence.
                
                
                <br><br><br>A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981 along with the nearby Shalamar Gardens (also spelled Shalimar), the Lahore Fort is located roughly 380 kilometres from the Pakistani capital city, Islamabad. Little is known of the city of Lahore prior to the Muslim period. Muslim raids by Arabs began in the 7th century and became more significant in the 12th century under the Turks. Around the 11th century, historical records say a mud fort was built on the site of the Lahore Fort under the reign of the Ghaznavid dynasty, during which Lahore served as the dynasty’s capital. The mud fort, along with most of the city, was destroyed during a Mongol attack in the 12th century.
                Over the years, the fort was rebuilt, destroyed, and rebuilt again. In 1524, Lahore was captured by the troops of the Mughal Babur. The Mughal Empire was an immensely successful Muslim empire of Turkic-Mongol origin. Its rulers controlled the entire subcontinent of India from the 16th to the mid-19th century. The present-day form of the Lahore Fort dates from 1575, when the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great occupied the fort, rebuilt with stone, to guard his empire’s northwest frontier.
                Succeeding Mughal rulers added palaces and gardens and greatly expanded the citadel. Emperor Jahangir added the Kala Burj pavilion, striking for its European-inspired angels. Jahangir was said to have been attracted to Christian themes, and paintings of the Madonna and Jesus were added to the fort during his reign, alongside images from Persian mythology. His massive Picture Wall decorated with ornate mosaics is definitely a sight to behold.
